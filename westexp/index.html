				This website will explain and inform its audience on the events and actions of the 19th century, detailing the impact they had on the landscape, the Native Americans, and the westward growth of the United States.  Topics supporting the claims presented about Native Americans, people settling westward, and the US Government include the ideas and beliefs of Manifest Destiny, the Indian Removal Act of 1830 under the Jackson administration, what physical and economic properties of the west lured people to settle there, and the impact of westward expansion on the Native Americans living where America was set to expand.
