			The impact of westward expansion on the Native Americans was only negative, resulting in the death and suffering of hundreds of thousands of native peoples.  One such example of the impact of manifest destiny and the desire for expansion on the Native Americans was the forced removal of the Cherokee nation and the resulting Trail of Tears.  The trail of tears was the direct result of the Indian Removal Act and the discovery of gold in Georgia.  The Cherokee, thanks to a 1791 treaty with the US Government, owned land in northern Georgia, land which was greatly desired by settlers after the discovery of gold.  After Georgia tried to reclaim the Cherokee’s land, the Cherokee taking their case to the Supreme Court and getting a favorable ruling, and the Jackson administration forcing the Cherokee out of their land against the court’s ruling, the Cherokee were forced to move to present-day Oklahoma.  The forced march from Georgia to Oklahoma was called the “Trail of Tears”, as approximately 1/3rd of the Cherokee people died traveling to Oklahoma.  The Trail of Tears was just one example of many horrible acts committed against the Native Americans, thanks to Manifest Destiny and Westward Expansion.
