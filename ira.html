				The Indian Removal Act was signed into law by President Andrew Jackson in 1830.  This act allowed the United States government to negotiate the relocation of the Native Americans from territories east of the Mississippi River, effectively pushing Native Americans out of their lands and homes to strange, foreign lands west of the Mississippi, around modern Oklahoma.  One of the main points of the Indian Removal Act was to force peaceful negotiations on the Native Americans, lessening tensions between with the US and the natives.  White settlers had been pushing into Native American land illegally, and the government wanted a peaceful alternative to conflict between the two groups.  The five major tribes relocated by the Indian Removal Act were the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole.  These tribes were called the “Five Civilized Tribes”, whose people had learned to read, write, and had a formal constitution for their governments.  One example of a treaty between the US Government and a Native American tribe was the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek.  This treaty, between the US and the Choctaw tribe, was the first officially signed treaty under the Indian Removal Act.  It exchanged land the 11 million acres of land in Mississippi owned by the Choctaw for 15 million acres of land in modern Oklahoma.
