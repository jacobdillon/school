				White settlers from the east United States wanted to move and expand westward for many reasons, taking advantage of economic, social, and political opportunities.  One such political opportunity was the Homestead Act of 1862, signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln.  The Homestead Act encouraged people to settle west by giving each settler 160 acres of public land, in exchange for a small filing fee.  This act led to the distribution of 80 million acres of public land to settlers by the year 1900.  The economic and social prospects for settling in a new territory and starting a new life out west was highly appealing to economically struggling families in the east.  Railroad companies working on the transcontinental railroad offered cheap, privately owned land to settlers, complete with benefits such as temporary housing, low interest rates, and the ability to pay on years credit.  Other economic opportunities available to settlers were the prospect of striking it rich in the gold rush or forming a farm on fertile farm land.
