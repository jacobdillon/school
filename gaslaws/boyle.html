				<p>
				Boyle's law relates to the volume and pressure of a gas.  The relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas is inversely proportional: as the pressure of the gas increases, the volume will proportionately decrease, and vice versa.  The constants in Boyle's law is the temperature of the gas and the amount of gas held in the container.  The equation for Boyle's law is P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>.
