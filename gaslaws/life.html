				<p>
					Thanks to Charles's law, the volume of a gas increases when the temperature of that gas increases.  This causes the gas to be less dense, and in the case of hot air balloons, less dense than the air around it, providing lift for the balloon.

				<p>
					Thanks to Gay-Lussac's law, the pressure of a gas increases when the temperature of that gas increases.  When left by heat, the gas inside of an aerosol can put more pressure on the can.  Along with more gas being created by the liquid propellant turning into gas, the pressure inside an aerosol can can cause it to explode.
