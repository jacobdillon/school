				Manifest Destiny, a phrase coined in 1845 by John L. O'Sullivan, was a highly popular belief during the 19th century that the United States of America had a God-given right to expand and control western territories in North America, stretching from coast to coast.  O’Sullivan coined the term “Manifest Destiny” in a column in the New York Morning News, stating that “[the] claim is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federated self-government entrusted to us”.  Many Americans believed that God had blessed America and its desire to expand, and that it was the US’ duty to spread civilization and Christianity in order to stop the “savages” and “heathens” represented by groups, such as the Native Americans.  Of the many conflicts spawned by the idea of Manifest Destiny, the conflicts between the US government and the Native American tribes were certainly the greatest.  Battles such as the Battle of Bad Axe, when over 150 Sauk and Fox people were killed after rebelling against settlers in the Illinois and Wisconsin territories, show how great the impact of Manifest Destiny and Westward Expansion was on the Native Americans.
