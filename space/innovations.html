				<li>Reusable Rockets - Rockets are usually ejected from their cargo upon attaining a specific height in space/orbit.  This is very costly, resulting in millions of dollars being spent to produce new rockets every time something needs to go into space.  Multiple companies have worked to remedy this problem with reusable rockets.  The hardest part about successfully reusing a rocket is landing it - most rockets do not have enough fuel left after getting its cargo into space to land back on the ground.  Recently, both SpaceX and Blue Origin have had successful tests with reusable rockets, with both landing all or parts of their boosters back on Earth safely and with minimal damage.</li>
				<li>Rockets Detachable from Boeing 747s - Virgin Galactic has been working to eliminate the cost of launch pads from the process of spaceflight by strapping rockets underneath the wings of Boeing 747-400 airplanes.  Once the 747 reaches an appropriate altitude, the rocket's engines fire up and continue the path of putting a payload into the Earth's orbit.</li>
				<li>Supersonic Speeds - Another Virgin Galactic innovation is its use of supersonic-speed-reaching rockets on its SpaceShipTwo, a space plane intended for commercial use.  SpaceShipTwo was able to reach speeds of Mach 1.4, or 1.4 times the speed of sound at an altitude of 71,000 feet.</li>
