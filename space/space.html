			The 20th century Space Race, occurring between 1955 and 1969, was a greatly competitive and innovative time for the world of rockets and space exploration.  With great leaps forward in science by both the USSR and the USA, events such as the launch of the Sputnik 1, the launch of Explorer 1, the formation of NASA, Yuri Gagarin becoming the first man in space, Alexei Leonov performing the first spacewalk, and Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking the moon fueled world interest in space. <br /><br />
				The great leaps forward in space innovation fueled by the private space industry mirror those in the original Space Race.  With multiple companies competing for multi-million dollar contracts with the government and other companies who want to put satellites into Earth's orbit, each player in the new Space Race wants to innovate and create new technologies in order to explore places like Mars, reduce overall space-travel costs by creating reusable rockets, or make commercial space travel viable.
