				The rise of the private space industry will be remembered for its great innovations and its similarities to the 20th century Space Race.  The events of that Space Race closely mirror events of the private Space Race, with many different factions trying to explore, obtain knowledge, and expand capabilities.  History has proven to repeat itself, with great inventions and innovations.
